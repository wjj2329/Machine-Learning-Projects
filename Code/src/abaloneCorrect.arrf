%4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
%
%   Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.  The age of
%   abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it,
%   and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and
%   time-consuming task.  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are
%   used to predict the age.  Further information, such as weather patterns
%   and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.
%
%   From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the
%   majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the
%   continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).
%
%   Data comes from an original (non-machine-learning) study:
